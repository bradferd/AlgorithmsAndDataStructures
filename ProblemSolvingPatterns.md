# Patterns for Problem Solving

## Frequency Counters
* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
* This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O($n^2$) operations with arrays / strings
* [Frequency Counter Examples](FrequencyCounter.js)
# 
## Multiple Pointers
* Creating pointers of values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
* Very efficient for solivng problems with minimal space complexity as well.
* [Multiple Pointers Examples](MultiplePointers.js)
# 
## Sliding Window
* This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
* Depending on a certain condition. the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
* Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
* [Sliding Window Example](SlidingWindow.js)
# 
## Divide and Conquer
* This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data.
* This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity.
