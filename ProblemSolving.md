# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## What the heck is an Algorithm? 
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

## How do I improve my problem solving skills
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns

## Understand the Problem
- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What is the expected output that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples
- Start with simple examples (Start with easiest use cases)
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with Empty Inputs
- Explore examples with Invalid Inputs

## Break it down
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
  - This will force you to think about the code you'll write before you write it.
  - Gives you a chance to catch any misunderstandings or concept issues before coding and worrying about details such as syntax.

## Solve or Simplify
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor

- Questions to ask yourself
  - Can you check the result? Are you sure it works?
  - Can you derive the result differently?
  - How intuitive is your solution? Is it easily readible?
  - Can you improve the performance? (Time/Space Complexity)
  - Is your code neat? Does it follow style guidelines?
  - How have other people solved this problem?
